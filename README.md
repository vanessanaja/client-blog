# client-blog

This is an assignment where we had to interview a fellow student to create a blog page for them.

The student, which is our client, had to choose a color scheme, 2 fonts, a title for their blog as well as a blog post title.

Based on our interview, we had to create a page for their blog.

I would've chosen more different fonts for this project if I had the option as I don't believe the chosen fonts reflect the feminin nature of the blog title.

I did this assignment in HTML5 and CSS3.
